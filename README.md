Hello! 
After setting up some code to play around with the cEDH Metagame data @SquirrelmobMTG created, I decided to make my deck stats public, so here they are. I use an R script that creates data for every deck and then I play around with some stats. 

You can read more about how I codify powerlevel for my own decks here (Article coming soon). If you want decklists, they're on [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/users/AliceInQuantumland).

I also write articles including science communication themed deck techs. So far, you can read: 
- [Gifts to the Table (Parnesse)](https://quantumlandbooks.com/post/688027749349228544/gifts) (now The Stack Is Your Wonderland)
- [The Mathematics of Infection (Alesha)](https://quantumlandbooks.com/post/678417387877449728/the-mathematics-of-infection)
